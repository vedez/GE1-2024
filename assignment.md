# Games Engines 1 Assignment 2023

## The Metaverse That Can Be Named (is not the Metaverse)

A haiku poem about a one-legged old man in the metaverse:

One-legged old man
In the virtual world he flies
A bird with one wing

This haiku poem uses imagery and metaphor to convey the idea of a one-legged old man who is able to transcend his physical limitations in the virtual world of the metaverse. In the Metaverse, anything is possible. We, the Metaversians, understand that we can create anything we can dream or imagine. The aim of this assignment is to create a novel metaverse experience that pushes the boundaries of computer science, culture, art and the human experience. If you ever had a dream of flying, scoring the wining goal, playing in a trad session, flying through space etc. etc. etc. then this project is about creating your dream in the Metaverse and knowing the Godlike power of the Triangle. All hail the Triangle.

You will manage your project in a github repo, making documented commits as you make progress and include a detailed readme.md in your git repo along with your project. Here is [a template](assignmentreadme.md) you can use for your readme. Also you can use this [gitignore file](.gitignore). Here is [a tutorial on using git](gitlab.md) if you need to brush up!

You can work solo or on a team of up to three people.

 # Weighting

| Complexity | 30% |
| Project management & documentation | 30% |
| Proposal | 10% |

# Rubric

## Groovyness - Visuals & sound, Quality of outcome

| Grade | Indicative Aspects |
|-------|------------|
| 1     | Project is deployed to the Quest and has great framerate. It looks amazing with a high level of polish on the visuals. Great use of color and form. The object is fully usable in VR and AR. There is lots of functionality and interactivity - for example buttons to press, levers to turn, colors changing, movement, animation etc. Lots of novelty and originality. Use of visual effects such as particle system, post-processing or custom shaders to enhance visual quality. Has a clear visual style. Has great sound effects. Is very cool indeed. Super cool in fact. Special gold star, like Joe 90! |
| 2.1 | Maybe deployed to the Quest but has some glitches or runs just on PC not in AR. Looks pretty good with decent but simple self made models made in ProBuilder or Blender. No visual effects. Maybe a particle system. Sound effects grabbed from online sources. Some simple interactivity and button presses. Less coherent visual style. Good novelty value. |
| 2.2 |  One or two simple models made in ProBuilder or imported from online sources. No interactivity, just an animated visual. Running in the Unity editor. Little or no sound |
| Pass | Model from online source or primitive that does not do anything |
| Fail | Does not compile or little or no content |
 
 ## Complexity - Coding, maths, algorithm and system design 

 | Grade | Indicative Aspects |
 |-------|------------|
 | 1 | 15-20 hours work. A complex system that has lots of interactivity. 5 or 6 MonoBehaviors that interact and work together to implement the functionality of the hologram. A complex algorithm such as a generative system used to generate the effect. Several hundred lines of self written C# code. Nice gizmos on all the MonoBehaviors and ranges on public fields, where appropriate. Code separated into appropriate methods and classes, following [SOLID principles](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design). Code demonstrates techniques we have learned on the course including: coroutines, transforms, vectors, quaternions, physics, lerping and slerping, sound. Advanced use (such as scripting) of Unity systems including animation, shaders, particle systems. Deployed and demoed on the quest or in AR on a phone. |
 | 2.1 | 10-15 hours work. A less complex system that has interactivity. Several self written MonoBehaviors with other code included from tutorials and online sources. No gizmos. Long methods. Around 100 lines of self written C#, using some of the techniques we learned on the course such as manipulating the transform. Working on PC, maybe not VR. |
 | 2.2 | 5-10 hours work. A simple system with a script or two based on modifying the transform or something very basic implemented like a spiral or a simple voxel world. Or most of the functionality is derived from tutorials with little customization or understanding. Little interactivity. Works in Unity editor, but not tested as a build or on device. No use of other Unity systems. Random colors. No audio or inappropriate audio. |
 | Pass | < 5 hours work. A single C# script or all from a tutorial. Compiles and runs |
| Fail | No submission or nothing works |


## Project Management & Documentation

| Grade | Indicative Aspects  |
|-------|------|
| 1 |  Detailed initial proposal and plan. 30-40 commits. Feature branches. For team projects, an equal distribution of the commits. Commits all commented. All sections of the template filled out. Document includes reflective elements - What did I learn? Sources properly referenced. Embedded, public, listed youtube video (DO NOT CHECK THIS VIDEO IS MADE FOR KIDS). The video is made from a build, not from the Unity Editor and demonstrates all the features of your project |
| 2.1 | 20-30 commits. One or two branches. All sections of the template filled out. Sources properly referenced. Issues with the video. 
| 2.2 |10-20 commits, terse or no comments. No branches. Documentation incomplete, Evidence of reflective learning missing. missing references. Issues with the video |
| Pass | < 10 commits. terse or no comments. No branches. Documentation incomplete. No video |
